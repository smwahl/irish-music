   Em                        D     Bm 
A Stor Mo Chroi, when you're far away
		 D                 (Bm)    Em
From the house that you'll soon be leaving
		  Em             D            Bm
Sure it's many a time by night and by day
          D             Bm     Em
That your heart will be sorely grieving
        Em         G           D          Em
For the stranger's land may be bright and fair
    Em          G         D    Bm
And rich in all treasures golden
	   Em                    D          Bm
You'll pine, I know, for the long, long ago
        Em            Bm    Em
And the heart that is never olden

A Stor Mo Chroi, in the stranger's land
There's plenty of wealth and wailing
Though gems adorn the rich and the grand
There are faces with hunger pailing
The road is weary, and hard to tread
And the lights of their citie blind you
Oh turn, A Stor, to old Erin's shore
And the one you have left behind you

A Stor Mo Chroi, when the evening's mist
In the mountain and meadow is falling
Oh turn, A Stor, from the throng and list
And maybe you'll hear me calling
For the sound of a voice that you seldom hear
For somebody's speedy returning
Am(7)   Em
A rún, a rún, 
				D       Bm
Oh, won't you come back soon
To the one who really loves you
