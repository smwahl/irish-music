Capetown (Don Clark)

    Dno3                            Gno3             Dno3       
The sun it shines like murder as it stares us in the face
    Gno3                               G    Dno3/A
The dust it beats in clouds up off the road-o
    Gno3                 Dno3           Bm        (Asus) G
The police men they have dogs and their waiting by the bogs
       Dno3               Ano3          Dno3
but we have no fear we've been this way before

Chorus:
Oh we will walk together though some of are lame, 
some of us are weary, sick and sore-o
they may throw us into jail but we'll die before we fail
we will walk along together to cape town

Our comrade lies in prison for the telling of the truth
the way he looks, the place that he was born-o
in his cell he lies in rags, in the hoouse with all the flags
where the minister sits sipping on his tea

(Chorus)

Last time we walked together the army shed our blood
charged with horses, blade us down with gas-o
but we let our people know we'll not run before our foes
we will walk as long as one of us can stand

(Chorus)

They tell us that this journey will take a thousand years
some of us will die along the road-o
but to fall among your friends, who stand up like women and men
it is better far than living on your knees

(Chorus)
