I wish I was in Mobile Bay, 
screwing cotton all of the day
But I'm stowing sugar in the hold below,
Below, below, below

(Chorus)
Hey, ho, below, below
Stowing sugar in the hold below
Hey, ho, below, below
Stowing sugar in the hold below

The J.M. White, she's a new boat
Stem to stern she's mighty fine
Beat any boat on the New Orleans line
Stowing sugar in the hold below

(Chorus)

The engineer shouts through his trumpet
"Tell the mate we got bad news.
Can't get steam for the fire in the flue"
Stowing sugar in the hold below

(Chorus)

The captain's on the quarter deck
Scratchin' 'way at his old neck
And he cries out, "Heave the larboard lead"
Stowing sugar in the hold below

(Chorus)

So I wish I was in Mobile Bay, 
screwing cotton all of the day
But I'm stowing sugar in the hold below,
Below, below, below
