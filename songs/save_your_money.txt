       D                          G
It's a story and a true one, that oft times has been told
          D                               Am                  D
Save your money when you're young, you'll need it when you're old

    D                             G
Now if you are a single lad, i'll tell you what to do
D                                       Am    
Court and marry some pretty girl, that you'll find fair and true
   D                                     G             (Bm) 
Be well aware that she'll play fair, and never let her go
      D                                 Am                   D                 
Stick to her when you're young, you'll need her when you're old
	
Now if you are a merry man, heres what you should do
stay true to your wife and little ones, as you have sworn to do
stay away from the pubs and bars, where liquors bought and sold
It's there you'll spend your money boys, you'll need it when you're old

Now once I was a handy man, and quite a lively lad
I spent my money foolish, until no more I had
and now im old and feeble, im wet out in the cold
I wish I'd saved my money, for I need it now (spoken) I'm old
