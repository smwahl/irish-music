Farewell My Love and Remember Me -- Cathal McConnell

Our ship is ready to bear away
Come comrades, o'er the stormy seas
Our small white sails, they are unfurled
And soon we'll wave in a watery world

Do not forget Love, do not grieve
For the heart is true and can't deceive
My heart and hand, I will give to thee
So farewell my love and remember me.

Farewell my love, as bright as pearl
My Lovely dark haired, blue eyed girl
and when I'm sailin' the stormy sea
I hope in Ireland you'll think on me

Do not forget Love, do not grieve
For the heart is true and can't deceive
My hand and heart, I will give to thee
So farewell my love and remember me.

Our ship is ready to bear away
Come comrades, o'er the stormy seas
Our small white sails, they are unfurled
And soon we'll wave in a watery world
