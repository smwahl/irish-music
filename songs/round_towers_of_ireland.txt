THE ROUND TOWERs OF IRELAND.

When an Irishman leaves the dear land of his birth,
And crosses the dark ragin' sea,
His heart will fly back to the land that he loves,
No matter how distant it be ;

Far off on the plains of some far foreign soil.
Far across the dark ragin' sea,
An image will rise and fill him with sighs,
And this is the picture that he sees.

CHORUS:
The glorious old Round Towers of Ireland,
the pretty little Shamrock so Green;
the Wolf hound lyin' down beneath the harp without the Crown,
And the Sunburst on Ireland between,

Long long may those memories remain in his heart,
As he sees the round towers that stand,
May the shine of past glories never depart,
While the sun sets her rays o'er our land,

And the harp so long silent will arise from her gloom,
And sounds the sweet notes as of yore,
May the Green Flag of Ireland once more be unfurled
And float over her own native shore.

CHORUS
