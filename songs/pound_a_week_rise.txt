Come all of you colliers that work down the mine
From Scotland to South Wales, from Teesdale to Tyne
I'll sing you a song of a pound a week rise
And the men who were fooled by the Government's lies

For a pound a week rise


In nineteen and sixty, a few years ago
The mineworkers' leaders to Lord Robens did go
Saying, "We work very hard, every day we risk our lives
And we ask you here and now for a pound a week rise"

Then up spoke Lord Robens, and he made this decree
"When the output rises then with you I will agree
To raise up all your wages, to give to you fair pay
For I was once a miner and I worked hard in my day"

So the miners they went home, they worked hard and well
With lungs full of coaldust in the bosom of hell
The output rose by sixteen, eighteen per cent and more
And when two years had passed and gone it rose above a score

Then the miners they went to get their hard-won prize
To ask Lord Robens for their pound a week rise
Robens wouldn't give a pound, he wouldn't give ten bob
He gave them seven-and-six and said, "Get back to your job"

So come all of you colliers, take heed what I say
And don't believe Lord Robens when he says he'll give fair pay
For he'll tell you to work hard, to make the output rise
You'll get Pie in the Sky instead of a one pound rise
