Of all the money that e'er I had
I spent it in good company
And all the harm I've ever done
Alas it was to none but me
And all I've done for want of wit
To mem'ry now I can't recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all

[Chorus]
So fill to me the parting glass
And drink a health whateâ€™er befalls
Then gently rise and softly call
Good night and joy be with you all

Oh if I had money enough to spend
and leisure time to sit awhile
there is a fair maid in this town
and she surely has my heart beguiled
her rosey cheeks, her ruby lips
I own she has my heart enthralled
so fill to me the parting glass
good night and joy be with you all

[Chorus]

Of all the comrades that e'er I had
They're sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had
They'd wish me one more day to stay
But since it fell unto my lot
That I should rise and you should not
I'll gently rise and softly call
Good night and joy be with you all

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
