My wee doggie would fand me in the Isla stream.

Ilka day I cross that water
Aye she's bracken wi' the sea
But if there is o' ale-hous laughter
Daurk an' still she waits on me. CHORUS

Like the fisher's line that's brawken
Leaves the salmon tae the swell
Monie's the naecht ye'll had me souken
But ye brak the line yersel. CHORUS

(Instrumental)

Aa' my days I've lived the cottar
								Bb
Baud and bonnie fines have I've seen
But should I dround in yon water
Bb
My wee doggie would fand me in the Isla stream. CHORUS
