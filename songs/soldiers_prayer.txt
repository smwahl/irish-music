A soldier and a sailor were walking one day,
Said the soldier to the sailor let's kneel down and pray,
And if we have one prayer may we also have ten,
May we have a bloody litany said the sailor amen.

The first thing we'll pray for we'll pray for some cash,
Glory Hallelujah to go on a bash,
And if we have one pound may we also have ten,
May we have the bank of England said the sailor amen.

The next thing we'll pray for we'll pray for some beer,
Glory Hallelujah to give us some cheer,
And if we have one pint may we also have ten, 
May we have a bloody brewery said the sailor amen.

The next thing we'll pray for we'll for a wench,
Glory Hallelujah and may she be French,
And if we have one wench may we also have ten,
May we have a bloody harem said the sailor amen.

The next thing we'll pray for we'll pray for a wife,
Glory Hallelujah the bane of our life,
And if we have one wife may we also have ten,
May they all live in Tipperary said the sailor amen.

The next thing we'll pray for we'll pray for our queen,
Glory Hallelujah and long may she reign,
And if she has one son may she also have ten,
May she have a bloody regiment said the sailor amen.

"Now who shall we pray for, let's pray for the Duke.
That wonderful handsome, great smiling plook
And if he loses one hair may he also lose ten".
"May the b*st*rd go baldy", said the sailor, "Amen".

"Now what shall we pray for, let's pray for our peace.
From Cape Town to Belfast, from Glasgow to Greece
And if we have one year, may we also have ten".
"May there never , ever be another war", said the sailor, "Amen"
