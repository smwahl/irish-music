Last Winter was a hard one

Last winter was a hard one, Missus Reilly, did you hear? 
'Tis well yourself that knows it, and it's been for many a day. 
Your husband wasn't the only one that sat beside the wall; 
My old man McGuinness couldn't get a job at all.

Chorus:
So rise up, Missus Reilly, don't give away to blues.
You and I will cut a shine, new bonnet and new shoes.
Hear the young ones cry, neither sigh nor sob.
And we'll wait till times get better and McGuinness gets a job.

The politicians promised them work on the boulevard.
To work with pick and shovel and load dirt on the cart.
Six months ago they promised them this work they'd surely get --
But ah, my good woman, they are promising it yet!

Bad luck to those Ey-talians, I wish they'd stayed at home. 
We've plenty of our own kind to eat up all our own. 
They come like bees in the summertime, swarming here to stay. 
Contractors, they hire them for forty cents a day.

They work upon the railway, they shovel snow and slush; 
One thing in their favor, Ey-talians never get lushed. 
They bring their money home at night and take no dinner wine. 
That's one thing I wish I could say for your old man and mine!

But springtime it is coming, and work we'll surely get.
My man'll get his job again; he makes a handsome clerk. 
Oh, See him climb the ladder as nimble as a fox; 
Says he's the man to handle the old three-cornered box
