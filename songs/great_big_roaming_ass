Oh, to look at me would you ever think that I was in me prime?
Me clothes are torn and me shoes are worn and me age is forty nine.
Oh, I had friends and pals galore but alas, those days are past,
And the only one that I have left is a poor old, shook old ass.

Chorus:

Oh, a kind old friend and a true old pal was this old ass to me.
Many's the night he brought me home when I was on the spree.
Though he's highly bred, heâ€™s badly fed for I don't own much grass,
He's a hare-um scare-um divil-may-care-um (a) great big roaming ass.

I bought this ass for a half a crown some many years ago.
We chanced to meet upon the street at the fair of Ballinasloe.
He took me high and he looked so fly (?) with his skin as smooth as glass.
And sure I put down with a half a crown and sailed home with me ass.

Chorus:

Oh, I'll ne'er forget the day we met, (sure) at the fair of Ballinasloe.
Up (hill) and down through street and town (Spoken): Go on! Click, click! Sure, the pair of us did go.
And to depart 't would break my heart, for no one could take his place,
And tell all of what I think of him, sure I think it's no disgrace.

Chorus:

Last line: Roaming (Roaring) fine jackass!
