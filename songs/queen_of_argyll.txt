      Dm                C G C      Dm              Am      C G C
Gentle men it is my duty      To inform you of one beauty
            Dm           Am          F           (G) Am       
Though I'd ask you of a favor, no to seek her for awhile
         Dm                   C G C   Dm                   C G C
Though I own she is a creature     Of character and feature
   Dm        Bb        F          (G)  Am             Dm
No words can paint the picture of the Queen of all Argyll

CHORUS (Same chord progression)

And if you could have seen her there, boys if you had just been there
The Swan was in her movement, and the morning in her smile
All the roses in the garden, they bow and ask her pardon
For not one could match the beauty of the queen of all Argyll

More Verses:

On that evening that I mention, I passed with light intention
Through a part of our dear country known for beauty and for style
Bein' a place of noble thinkers, of scholars and great drinkers
But above them all for splendour shone the Queen of all Argyll

CHORUS

Throw in a solo here.


So my lads my needs must leave you, my intention no to grieve you
Nor indeed would I decieve you, oh I'll see you in awhile
I must find some way to gain her, to court her and to tame her
I fear my heart's in danger from the Queen of all Argyll

CHORUS (do it twice or so)
