The shadows fell across the room as I lay down to rest

A storm was raging deep inside my head

I fell into a restless sleep

Of crazy changing dreams

But woke to find you standing by my bed


Clohinne winds were blowing when you called me

First you spoke my name

Your voice was still the same

You beckoned me and I arose

To follow where you led

Out among the wild Clohinne hills


The mountain mist had lent an eerie whiteness to the hill
The silver spider threadings caught my face
You darted through the bracken
Trailing stardust in your wake
I knew you'd stop beside our sacred place
Clohinne winds were blowing when you called me
First you spoke my name
Your voice was still the same
You beckoned me and I arose
To follow where you led
Out among the wild Clohinne hills
You stopped upon the fairy hill
Beneath the hawthorn tree
I thought I heard a lonely banshee wail
You held you hand towards me
And I reached to touch your face
But woke to find that you were just a dream
Clohinne winds were blowing when you called me
First you spoke my name
Your voice was still the same
You beckoned me and I arose
To follow where you led
Out among the wild Clohinne hills
The years have passed
And I am growing weary of this earth
The magic of the dream alludes me still
I've lain beneath the fairy tree
I've shouted to the moon
I am the haunted woman of the hill
Clohinne winds were blowing when you called me
First you spoke my name
Your voice was still the same
You beckoned me and I arose
To follow where you led
Out among the wild Clohinne hills
Out among the wild Clohinne hills
