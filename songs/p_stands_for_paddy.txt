P stands for Paddy, I suppose
J's for my love John
And the W stands for false Willy-O
But Johnny is the fairest man
Johnny is the fairest man, my love
Johnny is the fairest man
And I don't care what anybody says
For Johnny is the fairest man

As I went out one may morning
To take a pleasant walk
I sat myself down upon an old stone wall
To hear two lovers talk

To hear what they might say, my dear
To hear what they might say
That I might know a little more about love
Before I go away

CHORUS

Come and sit you down beside me, he says,
Together on the green
For it's a long three quarters of a year or more
Since together we have been

Oh I'll not sit by you, she says,
Now nor at any other time
For I hear you love another little girl
And your heart's no longer mine

Your heart's no longer mine, my dear
Your heart's no longer mine
It's a-just three quarters of a year or more
And your heart's no longer mine

CHORUS

And I'll go up the tall, tall tree
And I'll rob the wild bird's nest
And when I come down, I'll give a little love
To the girl that I love best

The girl that I love best, my dear
The girl that I love best
And down I'll come, and I'll go straight home
To the girl that I love best.

P stands for Paddy, I suppose
J for my love John
And the W stands for false Willy-O
But Johnny is the fairest man

Johnny is the fairest man, my dear
Johnny is the fairest man
And I know a little more about love
Before I travel on
