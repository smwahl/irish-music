Said the hawk unto the crow one day
Why do you in mourning stay?
I was once in love and I didn't prove fact
And ever since I wear the black

Ri-the-diddle, ri-the-diddle, ri-the-diddle-dum
Ri-the-diddle, ri-the-diddle, ri-the-diddle-dum
I was once in love and I didn't prove fact
And ever since I wear the black

And next up spoke Willy Wagtail
I was once in love and it did prevail
I was once in love and it did prevail
And ever since I wag my tail

Ri-the-diddle, ri-the-diddle, ri-the-diddle-dum
Ri-the-diddle, ri-the-diddle, ri-the-diddle-dum
I was once in love and it did prevail
And ever since I wag my tail

And next there spoke the little brown thrush
(As) she was sitting in yon holly bush
The way to court I've heard them say
Is to court all night and sleep the next day.

Ri-the-diddle, ri-the-diddle, ri-the-diddle-dum
Ri-the-diddle, ri-the-diddle, ri-the-diddle-dum
The way to court I've heard them say
Is to court all night and sleep the next day.

And last there spoke the young Jeannie Wran
Do you know what I'd do if I was a man?
If i fear'd my love would wriggle, once wrigle and go
I'd tie two stings unto my bow

Ri-the-diddle, ri-the-diddle, ri-the-diddle-dum
Ri-the-diddle, ri-the-diddle, ri-the-diddle-dum
If i fear'd my love would wriggle, once wrigle and go
I'd tie two stings unto my bow
