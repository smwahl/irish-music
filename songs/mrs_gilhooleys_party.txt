Mrs. Gilhooley's Party

Mrs. Gilhooley she gave a grand party one night
She invited us all to attend.
So we gathered a gang, and went 'round to her house
A few pleasant hours for to spend.
There was Trina and Meehall a few more and meself
a more impudent crowd hard for ta find,
But a t'ing most important we almost forgot
We near' left the old piper behind.

(Chorus)
We invited him down to the party
He brought his bagpipes just be chance
We asked him to sing, but he says, ``Ah, no''
But i'll play us a bit of a dance.
So he picked up his pipes, and he started to play
'til some one got foolin' about
And they cut a big hole in the bag o' his pipes
And this is the tune that came out:
(lilt 8 bars)

When the piper found out that his bag, it'd been cut
Well he made a great leap on the floor
His ciotóg* got working in fast-hammer style 
and he landed them under the jaw.
Well Mrs. Gilhooley, she fainted, they all made a rush
Trying to get out of the door
But the piper had nine of them takin' the count
And he swore he would lick twenty more.

So, if ever ya go to a party
Be sure to keep this in your mind
Don't fool about with the piper
And you'll find he's a gentleman kind
But if trouble should start, keep out of his way
For he carries an awful palltóg,**
Ah, you won't hear it comin' but *whoop* when it lands
Sure, you'll know it's an Irish ciotóg.*

(Chorus)
We invited him down to the party
He brought his bagpipes just be chance
We asked him to sing, but he says, 
``Ah Yes, I Might, I might, ah no no no."
But i'll play us a bit of a dance.
So he picked up his pipes, and he started to play
'til some one got foolin' about
And cut a big hole in the bag o' his pipes
And this is the tune that came out:
(lilt 16 bars)
