As I roved out one moonlit night
Excitement for to find
I met on the way with a pretty little girl
And I asked her to be mine

Chorus
With me tooraya folderiddle da
Me tooray-a right folderiddle-an tin-ido

How can I get to your father's house
How can I get to your bed
Oh me father locks the door at night
And the key lies under his head

If you get a ladder, thirty foot
Thirty foot and three
And place it up to the chimney top
Come down in a creel to me

So I got me a ladder, thirty foot
Thirty foot and three
And I placed it up to the chimney top
And down in a creel came me

But the old one she being still awake
Heard something that was said
I'll lay me life, said the silly old wife
There's a man in me daughter's bed

The old man he got out of bed
For to see if it was true
But she's pushed me down with her lily-white arms
Under(neath) the coverlet blue

Where are you going father, dear
Where are you going so late
You've disturbed me at my evening prayers
And, oh, but they were sweet

Well, the Divil take you silly old wife
And an ill death may you die
For your daughter's lying with the book in her arms
And she's praying for you and I

But the old one she being still awake
When something else was said
You can say what you like you silly old fool
There's a man in your daughter's bed

No rest no peace could the old one get
'til she got up to see
But her foot gave a shot to the chamber pot
And into the creel fell she

Rise and help me husband, dear
Rise and help me now
For the one that you have wished me to
I fear he has me now

Well, the hoult he's got I hope he keeps
And never lets it go
For between yourself and your daughter dear
It's time for the cock to crow

Well, I rocked her up and I rocked her down
And I gave her a great downfall
'Til every rib in the old woman's side
Played "Nick-nack" against the wall

Chorus
With me tooraya folderiddle da
Me tooray-a right folderiddle-antin-ido

And it's oh the blue the bonny blue
And may the blue do well
And every old woman 'd refuse her daughter
Rocked in a creel to hell
