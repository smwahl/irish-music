ROW ON
Words from ship's log, Three Brothers 1846
Set to music by Tim Laycock

Intro:
iE   iB,4 iA,5 iC#3 oD#3 oB5(+10) (+air)


(Drone E)
Clouds are upon the summer sky
There's thunder in the wind
Row on, Row on and homeward hie
Nor give one look behind 

Chorus:
    iE,8                oA8 
Row on, row on, another day
                        oB5(+10)
May shine with brighter light
iB,4                       iA10
Ply, ply the oars and pull away
		oB5(+10)        iB,4
There's dawn beyond the night

Bear where thou goest the words of love
Say all that words can say
Changeless affections, strength to prove
Then speed upon the way

Like yonder river would I glide
To where my heart would be
My barque should soon outsail the tide
That hurries to the sea

But yet a star shines constant still
Through yonder cloudy sky
And hope as bright my bosom fills
From faith that cannot die
