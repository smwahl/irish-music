There once was a boy, a bonny, bonny boy
And I loved him, I will vow and protest.
I loved him so well, so very, very well,
|:That I built him a bower on my breast. :|

It was up the green valley and down the green hill,
Like one so troubled in mind
I whooped and I shouted and I played upon my pipe,
|: But no bonny boy could I find. :|

So I sat myself down on a green mossy bank
Where the sun shone wonderful warm;
And who should I spy but my own bonny boy
|: Fast locked in some other girl's arms. :|

Now the girl who's the joy of my own bonny boy
Let her make of him all that she can.
And whether he loves me or whether he don't,
|: I'll walk with that boy now and then. :|
