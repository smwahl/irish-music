Before we part, I'll wage a crown, she's fain to follow it yet

The snows they melt the soonest when the winds begin to sing
The swallow flies without a thought as long as it is spring
But when spring goes and winter blows my love then you'll be fain
For all your pride to follow me across the raging main

The snows they melt the soonest when the winds begin to sing
And the bee that flew when summer shone in winter cannot sting
And I've seen a woman's anger melt between the night and the morn
So it's surely not a harder thing to melt a woman's scorn

So send me no farewell here, no farewell I'll receive
For you shall set me to the stile, then kiss and take your leave
And I'll wait here till the moorcock calls and the martlet takes the wing
        iB,4+7    oD4       oG4     iC,8+12  iB,8+4  oD4      iE5
