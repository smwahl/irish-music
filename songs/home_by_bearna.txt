Home by Bearna

    Emod 
In Scartaglen there lived a lass
    Dmod
And every Sunday after mass
    Emod/B
She would go and take a glass
   D             (Bm)  Emod/B
Before goin' home by Bearna
   Emin
We won't go home along the road
   Dmod
For fear that you might act the rogue
   Cmod
We won't go home along the road
D             (Bm)
We'll go home by Bearna

(8 bars of the Swallowtail Jig)
​
We won't go home across the fields
The big thornins could stick in your heels
We won't go home across the fields
We'll go home by Bearna
We won't go home around the glen
For fear your blood might rise again
We won't go home around the glen
But we'll go home by Bearna

We won't go down the milk boreen
The night is bright we might be seen
We won't go down the milk boreen
But we'll go home by Bearna
We won't go home across the bog
In fear we might meet Kearney’s dog
We won't go home across the bog
But we'll go home by Bearna

We won't go home along the bay
The tinkers' camp is on the way
We wont go home along the bay
But We'll go home by Bearna
We won't go home along the main
The swoogh is sure to rise again
We won't go home along the main
We'll go home by Bearna

We won't go home along the shore
For fear we'll hear the banshee roar
We won't go home along the shore
But We'll go home by Bearna
We won't go home along the strand
We might disturb the fairy band
We won't go home along the strand
But We'll go home by Bearna
 
In Scartaglen there lived a lass
And every Sunday after mass
She would go and take a glass
Before goin' home by Bearna
We won't go home along the road
For fear that you might act the rogue
We won't go home along the road
We'll go home by Bearna
