Robert Burns

Oh, Wilt thou go wi' me sweet Tibby Dunbar
Oh, Wilt thou go wi' me sweet Tibby Dunbar
Wilt thou ride on a horse or be drawn in a cart
Or walk by my side sweet Tibby Dunbar

I care na thy daddie, his land or his money
I care na thy kin, sae high and sae lordly
But say that thou'lt hae me for better or waur
And come in thy coatie sweet Tibby Dunbar

I offer you nay thing in sillar (silver) or land
But gave your consent we'd be richer by far
What man could determine the price of your hand
So say that thou't tae me sweet Tibby Dunbar

Oh, wilt thou be known as a poor beggar's lady
And sleep in the heather rolled up in my plaidie
The sky for a roof and your candle a star
My love for a fire sweet Tibby Dunbar

Oh, Wilt thou go wi' me sweet Tibby Dunbar
Oh, Wilt thou go wi' me sweet Tibby Dunbar
Wilt thou ride on a horse or be drawn in a cart
Or walk by my side sweet Tibby Dunbar
