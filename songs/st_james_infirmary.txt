I went down to old Joe's bar room
On the corner by the square.
Well, the drinks were bein' served as usual,
And the motly crowd was there.

Well, on my left stood old Joe McKennedy
And his eyes were bloodshot red.
These were the words he said:
When he told me that sad sad story,

well I went down to the saint james infirmary
I saw my baby laying there
she was stretched out on a long white marble table
so cold, so sweet, so fair 

CHORUS:
Let her go, let her go, God bless her,
Wherever she may be,
She can search this wide world over
And never find another man like me.

There were sixteen coal black horses
to pull the rubber tired hack
there were seven women going to that graveyard
only six of them are coming back

CHORUS

When I die I want you to dress me in straight-laced shoes
a boxback coat and a stetson hat
put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch-chain
so the boys know i died standin pat

CHORUS

Get six gamblers to carry my coffin
Six chorus girls to sing me a song
Put a twenty-piece jazz band on my tail gate
To raise Hell as we go along

CHORUS

(well I went down to the saint james infirmary
I saw my baby laying there
she was stretched out on a long white marble table
so cold, so sweet, so fair )

CHORUS

Now that's the end of my story
Let's have another round of booze
And if anyone should ask you just tell them
I've got the St. James Infirmary blues
