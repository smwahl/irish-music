Silly Wizard Version

I am a young sailor, my story is sad
Though once I was carefree and a brave sailor lad
I courted a lassie by night and by day
Ah, but now she has left me and sailed far away

(Chorus)
Oh, if I was a blackbird, could whistle and sing
I'd follow the vessel my true love sails in
And in the top rigging, I would there build my nest
And I'd flutter my wings over her lily-white breast

Or if I was a scholar and could handle a pen
One secret love letter to my true love I'd send
And I'd tell of my sorrow, my grief and my pain
Since she's gone and left me in yon flowery glen

(chorus)

I sailed over the ocean, my fortune to seek
And though I missed her caress and her kiss on my cheek
I returned and I told her my love was still warm
But she turned away lightly and great was her scorn

(chorus)

I offered to take her to Donnybrook Fair
And to buy her fine ribbons to tie up her hair
I offered to marry and to stay by her side
But she says in the morning she sailed with the tide

(chorus)

My parents they chide me and will not agree
Saying that me and my false love, married should never be
Ah, but let them deprive me or let them do what they will
While there's breath in my body, she's the one that I love still

(chorus)


Laurels Version:

Chorus:
If I were a blackbird I'd whistle and sing
I would follow the vessel my true love sails in
And on the top rigging I'd there build my nest
And I'd flutter my wings o'er his handsome white breast

Well, I am a young maiden, my story is sad
For once I was loved by a brave sailor lad
He courted me sweetly, by night and by day
But now he has left me, and sailed far away

Chorus

His parents they slight me, and will not agree
That me and my sailor boy married should be
They sent him to sea, far away from my side
So he could not embrace me, or make me his bride

(Ah, but let them deprive me, let them do what they will
While there's breath in my body, he's the one that I love still)

Chorus


Well, he promised to take me to Donnybrook Fair
And to buy me red ribbons for to tie up my hair
He promised to build me a house by the sea
Where me and my sailor boy married would be

Chorus

If I were a scholar and could handle a pen
One secret love letter to my true love I'd send
And I'd tell of my sorrow, my anguish, my pain
Since he's gone and left me in yon flowery glen

Chorus
