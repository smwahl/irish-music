Chorus:
(So) Shove around the jug, me boys,
Chorus around the room,
We’re the boys that fear no noise
Although we’re far from home!

Well, I courted a girl in Albany,
One in Montreal,
One in Philadelphy,
But the best in Lewiston Falls.

Chorus:

When you get to Albany
Give the girls a call.
There’s none at all to be compared,
With the ones from Lewiston Falls.

Chorus:

When I came on from Ireland
I was just a lad.
But working these canal boats
Is the only life I’ve had.

Chorus:

A dollar in a tavern
Is very easy spent.
If I lived in Ireland,
I’d have to pay down rent.

Chorus:

Amsterdam or Liverpool,
Rome or Syracuse,
If you’d ever been to Lewiston Falls,
It’s the only place you’d choose.

Chorus:

A drunkard in the tavern,
There's fishes in the sea!
The cork is in the bottle,
But the whiskey is in me!

Chorus: (2x)
