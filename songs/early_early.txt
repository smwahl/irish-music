              D  C G           D  C  G
It was early, early all in the spring
             D  C   G                 D C G
when my love willie went to serve the king
                D  C G                  D  C G  
the night being dark and the winds being high
                C      G         D  C G 
and they parted me and my sailor boy

right well he knows that I can wash and rend?
right well he knows that I can card and spin
I can make up his linens be they course or fine
but the want of money leaves me behind

come get me into the little wee boat
where in the ocean that i might float
to view the french fleet as they passed 
that i might inquire for my sailor boy

Well she hadn't been long sailing upon the deep
when the lofty french fleet she chanced to meet
come tell to me now my bold ships crew
does my love willie sail onboard of you

oh no fair maiden your loves not here
he has been drownded of late I fear
near yon dark island that we passed by
it is there that we lost your fine sailor boy

she wrung her hands and she tore her hair
she was like a young girl in deep despair
against the rocks her wee boat she flung
saying what will i do now my love is gone

come get me ink a pen and paper too
and with her pen these two lines she drew
and every word sure she shed a tear
and that very tear she cried willie m'dear

with the marble stone at my head and feet
come dig my grave and dig it wide and deep
and on my breat place a snow-white dove
to let the world know that i died for love
