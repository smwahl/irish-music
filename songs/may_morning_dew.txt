How pleasant in winter
//         ~  
To sit by the hob
 /       ~          
Just listening to the barks
    ~             \\
And the howls of the dog
/						~
Or to walk through the green fields
   //  \	 ~	
Where wild daisies grew
				/  ~ 
To pluck the wild flowers
    /   /   ~
In the may morning dew

        /    /   ~
When summer is coming
 //         ~
When summer is near
	  /            /
With the trees oh so green
	 ~   /      /   ~
And the sky bright and clear
				   /   ~    
And the wee birds all singing
   //   ~     ~\  /
Their loved ones to woo
				   /    ~
And young flowers all springing
	/   /    ~
In the may morning dew

             /  ~
I remember the old folk
//            ~
All now dead and gone
      /          ~
And likewise my two brothers
~             ~\
Young Dennis and John
					 ~
How we ran o'er the heather
	  //   ~\  \    
The wild hare to pursue
                ~   /
And the proud deer we hunted
    /   /    ~
In the may morning dew

					~
Of the house I was born in
						~
There's but a stone on the stone
  /  /  
And now all 'round the garden
  ~            \\
Wild thistles have grown
  /               ~
And gone are the neighbours
 //  ~\  \\
That I once knew
		  ~       ~  
No more will we wander
		 /    /  ~
Through the may morning dew
