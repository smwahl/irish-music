When I was young and in my prime, My mind being free from care
Whilst leaving all in Donegal to wander far away
Whilst leaving all in Donegal to wander far away
That I might plough the raging main, going to Amerikay

In Creeslough town my friends stood round
And I bad adieu to all
In Creeslough town my friends stood round
And I bad adieu to all
And down Lough Foyle and away I went from the hills of Donegal

The night being dark and stormy, And loud the waves did roar
Our captain cries, "Hold off, me boys, our vessel's going ashore!"
Our captain cries, "Hold off, me boys, to deck you one and all!"
And I rued the day I sailed away from the hills of Donegal

My father he's a farmer, I mean to tell you all
Between Moville, near Derry, and the hills of Donegal
I, being like many's the foolish young lad, I thought I'd sail away
That I might plough the raging main, Going to Amerikay

Here's farewell unto Castlerock, likewise unto Downhill
And to that spot where we sailed by, they call it sweet Moville
From sweet Culmore to that foreign shore, Where waves do rise and fall
Adieu adieu to my wee lass on the hills of Donegal
