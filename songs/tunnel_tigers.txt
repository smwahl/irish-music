1. Hares run free on the Wicklow mountains,
Wild geese fly and foxes play;
Sporting Wicklow boys are working,
They're drivin' a tunnel through the London clay.

Up with the shields and the jackets it! Ram it!
Drivin' a tunnel through the London clay.

2. Lough Derg trout grow fat and lazy,
Salmon sport in Cushla bay;
fishermen from Connemara
Are drivin' a tunnel through the London clay.

3. Below Armagh are wild ducks breeding,
Wild fowl gather 'round Loch Rea,
sporting boys of Longford County
Are drivin' a tunnel through the London clay.

4. The curragh rots on the Achill Island,
Tourists walk on the Newport quay;
Mayo boys have all gone roving,
They're drivin' a tunnel through the London clay.

5. The Carlow girls are fine and handsome,
All decked out so neat and gay;
Carlow boys don't come to court 'em
They're driving a tunnel through the London clay.

6. Down in the dark are the tunnel tigers
Far from the sun and the light of day;
Down in the land that the sea once buried,
Driving a tunnel through the London clay.
