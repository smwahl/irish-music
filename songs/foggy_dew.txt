Instrumental verse

|f3 ed2 | c2 B2 c2 | d6 |

	 D
When I was a bachelor young and bold
	(+F#)	   G    (-d)   Bm    A
I followed the ro - ving  tra - il
    D/A  A            Bm        G
The only thing that I ever done wrong
  Bm        A        D/A 
I courted a handsome maid

Alternate:
  Bm2       D/A+C#   D+d 
I courted a handsome maid

  
I wooed her all the summertime
                
And part of the winter too
The only thing I ever done wrong
Was to keep off the foggy dew

|f3 ed2 | c2 B2 c2 | d6 |

(Harmonium comes in)

'Twas on one night about twelve o'clock
As I lay fast asleep
There came this maid to my bedside
And bitterly she did weep
    
	D+c#a 
She wept, she moaned, she tore her hair
	    D+F#a        G+g    Bm+f#  Am+e
And she cried "what shall I do?"
So I rolled her into bed
And covered up her head
For to keep off the foggy dew

|f3 ed2 | c2 B2 c2 | d6 |

Well all the first part all that night
And we did sport and play
And all the latter part of that night
Snug in my arms she lay

And when the broad daylight appeared
She cried "I am undone!"
Well hold your tongue
My pretty young girl
For the foggy dew has gone

(Slower)

Well I never told nobody her name
And its damned be if I do
But it's often times that i think on that night
That I kept off the foggy dew
