And her mouth was as red as the fresh fallen snow
The day she told me again
How another man's love was as white as a raven
While mine was blacker than blood
How another man's love was as white as a raven
While mine was blacker than blood

And I asked if she knew for sure that the rain in her eyes
Would never run dry
'Til the flames of the sun ran like ice in her veins
And froze the door to her heart
'Til the flames of the sun ran like ice in her veins
And froze the door to her heart

And she told me the last time as if for the first time
If the world turns away from the sun
Then nothing and never will always be true
That she would forever be mine
Then nothing and never will always be true
That she would forever be mine

And I swear that the sun in her eyes turned to stone
Her dress was as white as the moon
The priest told me nothing, and no one was true
That she would forever be mine
The priest told me nothing, and no one was true
That she would forever be mine

Oh the blackened sole of her small bright shoe
Has left it's mark in the long white hall of my heart
