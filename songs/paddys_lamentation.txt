Paddy's lamentation (ADAD)

          Dno3                   C                     Ano3
Well it's by the hush, me boys, put an end to all your noise
    Dno3            Dm,A         Gno3,D  Ano3
And listen now to  Paddy's lamen ta    tion
   Dno3                         C       Am
I was by hunger pressed and in poverty distressed
  Dm                   Ano3             Dno3
So I took a mind to leave the Irish nation

Chorus:
Dno3    Dm        F          Ano3
Here ye boys, and do take my advice
   Dno3          Dm,A           Gno3,D  Am
To Americay I'll have ye not be go     in'
            Bbno5            Dno3          C                 Am
For there's nothing here but war where the murderin' cannons roar
      Dm             Ano3             Dno3
And I wish I was at home in dear old Erin

Well I sold me horse and plow, sold my sheep and pigs and sow
My father's plot of land I then departed
And me sweetheart Bid McGee I'm afraid I'll never see
For I left her there back home quite broken-hearted

Well meself and a hundred more to Americay sailed o'er
Our fortunes to be makin' we were thinkin'
But when we got to yankee land they put a rifle my hand
Saying "Paddy, you must go and fight for Lincoln"

General Meagher to us he said: If you get shot or lose your head
Every mother's son of you shall have a pension
But me I lost me leg, now all  I got was a wooden peg
Boys, it is the truth to you I mention

Well I'd have thought myself in luck, to be standing on the dock
In Ireland, the country I delight in
To the devil I would say, you can curse Americay
For I am sick and tired of their hard fightin
