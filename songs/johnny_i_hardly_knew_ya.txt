[Em]While on the road to sweet Athy, ha-[D]roo, ha-roo,
While [Em]on the road to sweet Athy, ha-[G]roo, ha-[B7]roo,
While [Em]on the road to [D]sweet Athy,
A [C]stick in the hand, a [B7]drop in the eye,
A [Em]doleful [D]damsel [C]I heard [B7]cry.
[Em]Johnny, I hard[D]ly knew [Em]ya.

[Em]With your drums and guns and guns and drums, Ha-[D]roo, ha-roo
[Em]With your drums and guns and guns and drums, Ha-[G]roo, ha-[B7]roo
With [Em]your drums and guns and [D]guns and drums
The [C]enemy nearly [B7]slew ya;
Me [Em]darling [D]dear, you [C]look so [B7]queer.
[Em]Johnny, I hard[D]ly [Em]knew ya.

Where are the eyes that looked so mild ha-roo, ha-roo
Where are the eyes that looked so mild ha-roo, ha-roo
Where are the eyes that looked so mild
When my poor heart you first beguiled
Why did you run from me and the child, Johnny I hardly knew ya.

Chorus
Where are the legs with which you ran, ha-roo, ha-roo,
Where are the legs with which you ran, ha-roo, ha-roo,
Where are the legs with which you ran,
When first you went to carry a gun?
Indeed your dancing days are done.
Johnny, I hardly knew ya.

Chorus
It grieved my heart to see you sail ha-roo, ha-roo
It grieved my heart to see you sail ha-roo, ha-roo
It grieved my heart to see you sail
Though from my heart you took leg-bail
Like a cod you’re doubled up head and tail,
Johnny I hardly knew ya

Chorus
You haven’t an arm, you haven’t a leg, ha-roo, ha-roo,
You haven’t an arm, you haven’t a leg, ha-roo, ha-roo,
You haven’t an arm, you haven’t a leg,
You’re an eyeless, noseless, chickenless egg,
You’ll have to be put with a bowl to beg.
Johnny, I hardly knew ya.


Chorus
They’re rolling out the guns again, ha-roo, ha-roo,
They’re rolling out the guns again, ha-roo, ha-roo,
They’re rolling out the guns again
But they never will take our sons again
No they never will take our sons again
Johnny I’m swearing to ya.
