Oh The smartest packet ye can find                         
Ah Hey Ah Ho! Are you most done
Is the Old Wildcat of the Swallowtail Line
( Margaret Evans on a blue sky line)
So clear away the track and let the bulgine run

CHORUS  sung after each verse
To me Hey Rig-a-jig, in a jaunting car 
Ah Hey Ah Ho Are you most done
 With Eliza Lee all on my knee 
 So clear away the track and let the bulgine run 
 
O  the Old Wildcat of the Swallowtail Line -
Ah Hey Ah Ho Are you most done
She's never a day behind her time -  
So clear away the track and let the bulgine run

O  we're outward bound for New York Town -
Ah Hey Ah Ho Are you most done
Them bowery gals we'll waltz around -  
So clear away the track and let the bulgine run

When we've stowed our freight at the West Street Pier - 
Ah Hey Ah Ho Are you most done
It's home to Liverpool then we'll steer - 
So clear away the track and let the bulgine run

O them bowery gals will give us fun - 
Ah Hey Ah Ho Are you most done
Chatham Street dives is home from home - 
So clear away the track and let the bulgine run

When we all gets back to Liverpool town  
Ah Hey Ah Ho Are you most done
I'll stand ye whiskies all around -  
So clear away the track and let the bulgine run

O  heave a pawl- O bear a hand - 
Ah Hey Ah Ho Are you most done
Just one more pull and make her stand - 
So clear away the track and let the bulgine run

O when I gets home across the sea - 
Ah Hey Ah Ho re you most done
Eliza will you marry me -  
So clear away the track and let the bulgine run
