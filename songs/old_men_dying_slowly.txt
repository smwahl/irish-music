Old men Dying slowly, young men dying fast (Amelia Hogan)

In (the) west [by god?] Virginia, where the mighty chestnuts stood
The air is full of carbon and the creeks are full of mud
The Mountain's full of tunnels dyed in iron and blood
In (the) west [by god?] Virginia, where the mighty chestnuts stood

are old men dying slowly, young men dying fast
the history of the miner is buried in the blast
the cities of the east are built upon the backs
of old men dying slowly, young men dying fast

And what gave us the right, to cut a power line
through the ancient core of this body serpentine
wasting the earth, wasting peoples lives
(cutting) through the ancient core of this body serpentine

are old men dying slowly, young men dying fast
the history of the miner is buried in the blast
the cities of the east are built upon the backs
of old men dying slowly, young men dying fast

cutting holes into the mountain, cutting sky into the trees
the mountain is to old to defend herself from thee 
Nameless at (your) work, on your hands and knees  (???)
cutting sky into the mountain, cutting holes into the trees

are old men dying slowly, young men dying fast
the history of the miner is buried in the blast
the cities of the east are built upon the backs
of old men dying slowly, young men dying fast
