in A, starting note A

I rolled with Roarin' Mary and I cuddled Bonnie Kate,
I got drunk with Bonnie Annie, scared The Pigeon off the Gate,
After all these comely maidens with whom I did parade,
I most often took my chances with the darlin' Sligo Maid.

Dithery-um.....

Tim Moloney took The Bag o' Spuds, it was heavy load,
Fed them out to Jenny's Chickens goin' West Along the Road.
The Merry Maids of Mitchellstown are missin' from the floor,
They'll be in The New Mown Meadows with The Bucks of Oranmore.

Dithery-eye...

2x A part

Lord MacDonald and Lord Gordon swing the Lasses from Fermoy,
But sure Drowsie Maggie told me that they were The Soldier's Joy.
I met with Tim Moloney, he was feelin' mighty proud,
As the hielan' done the highland with the darlin' Miss McLeod.

I met The Jolly Tinker, he was singin' like a thrush,
And The Lark was in the Mornin' and The Bird was in the Bush.
After all my great adventures with these maidens great and small,
I settled down and married to The Girl From Donegal.

Die-dle dithery...
