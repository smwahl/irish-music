So Will we yet

     Gno3                   Dno3         C
Come sit down beside us and give us your craic
        Gno3                          Csus4  Dno3     Gno3          
Let the wind lift the burden of this life up off your back
		Gno3                     Csus2       D/A      
For our hearts to despondency we never shall submit
          Gno3        Dno3             Csus4   Asus4  Dno3/A
For we’ve always been provided for and so will we     yet 

	Gno3                Dno3        Csus2    
And so will we yet, and sae will we yet
      Gno3        Dno3             C       Asus4 Dno3/A
We’ve always been provided for and so will we    yet 

So fill up your tankards with nappy brown ale
It'll comfort our heart and enliven the tale
For we'll know we will be merrier the longer that we sit
For we've drunk together manys the time, and so will we yet..


Here's a health to the farmer, who prospers the plough
Rewarding his ardent toil all the year around
For in seed-time and harvest-time we ever shall get
For we've left it all to providence, and so will we yet

 
Come lift up your voices with laughter and song
May your days be brighter and your nights not so long
For your joys were welcome here, as woes you would forget
And when you wept we wept with you and so will we yet.

So fill up your glasses, let the bottle go round
For the sun it will rise up, tho' the moon has gown down
And tho' the room be spinning round about, we've time enough to flit
When we fell we all got up again, and so will we yet
