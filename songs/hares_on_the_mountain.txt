Oh Sally, my dear
 
I wish I could wed you

(interlude)

If all you young men
Were like hares on the mountain
If all you young men
Were like hares on the mountain
How many young girls would take guns and go hunting?

If the young men could sing
Like blackbirds and thrushes
If the young men could sing
Like blackbirds and thrushes
How many young girls would go beating the bushes?

If all you young men
Were fish in the water
If all you young men
Were fish in the water
How many young girls would undress and dive after?

(interlude)

But the young men are given
To frisking and fooling
To frisking and fooling
But the young men are given
So, I'll leave them alone and attend to my schooling
