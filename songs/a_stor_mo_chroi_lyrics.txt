A Stor Mo Chroi, when you're far away
From the home that you'll soon be leaving
Sure it's many a time by night and by day
That your heart will be sorely grieving
For the stranger's land may be bright and fair
And rich in all treasures golden
You'll pine, I know, for the long, long ago
And the heart that is never olden

A Stor Mo Chroi, in the stranger's land
There's plenty of wealth and wailing
Though gems adorn the rich and the grand
There are faces with hunger pailing
The road is toilsome, and hard to tread
And the lights of their cities blind you
Oh turn, A Stor, to that Eastern shore
And the one you have left behind you

A Stor Mo Chroi, when the evening's mist
Over mountain and sea is falling
Oh turn, A Stor, from the throng and list
And maybe you'll hear me calling
For the sound of a voice that you seldom hear
For somebody's speedy returning
A run, a run, (Tempo and chord progression changes here)
Oh, won't you come back soon
To the one who really loves you
