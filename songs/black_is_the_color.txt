I love the ground whereon she stands 

I love my love and well she knows 
I love the ground whereon she goes. 
But some times I wish the day will come 
WHen she and I will be as one 

Black is the color of my true love`s hair 
Her lips are like some roses fair 
She`s the sweetest smile and the gentlest hands. 
I love the ground whereon she stands 

I walk to the Clyde for to mourn and weep 
But satisfied I ne'er can sleep 
I'll write her a letter, just a few short lines 
And suffer death ten thousand times 

Black is the color of my true love`s hair 
Her lips are like some roses fair 
She`s the sweetest smile and the gentlest hands. 
I love the ground whereon she stands
