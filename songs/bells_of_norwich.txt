Loud are the bells of Norwich and the people come and go.
Here by the tower of Julian, I tell them what I know.

C G D - / G C D G

Ring out, bells of Norwich, and let the winter come and go
All shell be well again, I know.

Love, like the yellow daffodil, is coming through the snow.
Love, like the yellow daffodil, is Lord of all I know.

CHORUS

Ring for the yellow daffodil, the flower in the snow.
Ring for the yellow daffodil, and tell them what I know.

CHORUS

All shall be well, I'm telling you, let the winter come and go
All shall be well again, I know.

Loud are the bells of Norwich and the people come and go.
Here by the tower of Julian, I tell them what I know.

CHORUS

All shall be well, I'm telling you, let the winter come and go
All shall be well again, I know.
