Nil 'na lá (Daybreak has not yet come)
Translation compiled by Don Clark

 
  Dno3         Gno3    
I wander down into the town
    D                    Bm7  Asus4          
And try my luck with the tavern lady

I throw a guinea down to pay

And drink my fill until the closing

 

CHORUS (phonetic from Jimmy Crowley)

Nil 'na lá, má 'na lá

Nil 'na lá, na nom fadim

Nil 'na lá, má 'na lá

Ban da rágus e mir vaga

 

Siobhán she is a fine young girl

In her new dress just from the maker

I gaze down at my golden coin

A-spinning on the old oak table

CHORUS

Don't send me out into the dark

The night is cold and I'll be perished

Come to bed with me awhile

We'll have a roll around the blankets

 CHORUS

The sheep have eaten all the corn

The calves have drunk up all the milk now

Potatoes they go all unsold

Senseless man, won't you go home

 CHORUS

Aren't I the man who has no sense?

To pour rent money down my throat now

I heap such sorrow on myself

And better fortune on all others

 CHORUS

I left my shoes now in the pub

I left my stockings and my pipe there

The cocks have all begun to crow

It's time to me to leave for home

CHORUS
