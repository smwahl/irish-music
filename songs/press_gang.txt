Press Gang

As I walked out on London Street
A press gang there I chanced to meet
They asked me if I'd join the fleet
On board of a man-o-war, boys

Come brother shipmates tell to me
What kind of treatment they give you
That I may know before I go
On board of a man-o-war, boys

When I got there to my surprise
All they had told me was shocking lies
There was a row and a jolly old row
On board of a man-o-war, boys

The first thing they done they took me in hand
They lashed me with a ?tar of a strand?
They flogged me till I could not stand
On board of a man-o-war, boys

Now I was married and me wife's name was Grace
'Twas she that led me to shocking disgrace
It's oft I'd curse her ugly face
On board of a man-o-war, boys

When next I get may foot on shore
To see them London girls once more
I'll never go to sea no more
On board of a man-o-war, boys
