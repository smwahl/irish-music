Rock the Machine - Lisa O'Neill
G (Capo 5th fret)

G                     C  G
I'm losing will love
G                    C      G
My hands are soft as cotton gloves
Machine has eaten up my job
My meaning, my cause.
Machine with the strength of a hundred men,
Can't feed and clothe my children,
Can't greet a sailor comin' in,
Or know of desperation.

I shovel coal down Spencer's dock.
I took you dear into wedlock.
And you did bear us a beautiful flock,
River rock the machine down on the docks.
River rock the machine until it stops.

Oh low Liffey, show me gold!
C2                        G
(And) Like a heron I will go.
C2                             G
Oh, roaring Liffey when you're high
C2                       G
Like a cormorant I will dive.
Am                            C2
And the gold will glow I will rise,
G                            C
With gold enough to win back time.
With gold enough to win back pride.
River rock the machine until it dies.

Today dear I am unemployed.
Before I spoke you read my eyes.
I feared of nothing or no one.
But I feel old and I'm so young.
I miss the graft I miss the boys,
I plead for purpose in the void.
Time is inward, ticking tighter,
I wish my load was a mountain lighter.

I shovel coal down Spencer's dock.
I took your dear into wedlock.
And you did bear us a beautiful flock,
River rock the machine down on the dock.
River rock the machine until it stops.

Oh low Liffey, show me gold!
(And) Like a heron I will go.
Oh, roaring Liffey when you're high
Like a cormorant I will dive.
And the gold will glow I will rise,
With gold enough to win back time.
With gold enough to win back pride.
River rock the machine until it dies.

River rock the machine down on the dock
River rock the machine until it stops.
