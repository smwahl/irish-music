Tak a dram afore ye go


O the evenin's passed sae quickly
An the music's almost done,
Heard the piper an the fiddler,
The singer an his song;
The time has come for us tae leave you,
One more song before we go;
Sae button up an aye be cheery
An tak a dram afore ye go.
    Sae button up an aye be cheery
    An tak a dram afore ye go.

An this nicht we will remember,
Fur the music's been just fine,
But the cauld, grey land o Caithness
Can be cruel and unkind;
Sae we must bid fareweel an leave you
Traivel through the ice an snaw;
Sae button up an aye be cheery
An tak a dram afore ye go.
    Sae button up an aye be cheery
    An tak a dram afore ye go.

So goodnight and God go wi' you
An watch over you until
We can aa meet here thegither
An oor glasses we will fill;
We will drink a health tae absent friens
An let the beer an whisky flow;
Sae button up an aye be cheery
An tak a dram afore ye go.
    Sae button up an aye be cheery
    An tak a dram afore ye go.
    Sae button up an aye be cheery
    An tak a dram afore ye go.
